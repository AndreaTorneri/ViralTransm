# ViralTransm
A simulation-based model of viral transmission based on the effective contact process

This repository present a simulation-based model of viral transmission to simulate the spread of an infectious disease within a host population. 
A theoritical description of the model is given in "TheoreticalDescription.pdf".
Simulation scripts are developed in R.
